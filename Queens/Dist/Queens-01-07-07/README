To compile: Read or Run build.sh script.

To run program:  see instructions printed by queens --help 
Each run prints the number of arrangements.  This number is preceeded
by a printout of the arrangements themselves if the --show-boards
option is given.

To use perl scripts to do runs for successive numbers of columns
and compute the difference table for the results:  Edit the self-explanatory
variable settings near the top of the script and run it.  
  diffs_startn.pl does it for queen pieces
  diffs_startn_knight does it for knight pieces.

Note for knights and kings: The placements with 1 piece per row are
found when program defaults are used.  To count with more than one
piece per row, you must specify the number of pieces in each row
by using the --pieces-per-row n1,n2,...,nr option.

To implement new kinds of pieces:  Just edit PieceZoo.cpp and rebuild.
  Do just two things: (1) Add a class for the new piece that codes a 
test for whether two pieces on given squares attack each other.  Follow
the examples of QueenTester and KnightTest. (2) Add a line to specify what 
name the user should give to select the new piece.
